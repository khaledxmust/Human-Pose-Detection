# Human-Pose-Detection
Deep Neural Network | Transfer Learning Based on MPII Dataset

The objective of this project is to create a Training Model to understand and provide a classification for the images given and another bonus Training Model that provides further description about the activity that the human is doing in the image in ease the Model should train on training dataset then to be able to predict the Category and the Activities of any unseen image data associated with it.

Category Identification:

1. Installing required libraries
2. Getting Data and Annotations and extracting them
3. Displaying Sample images
4. Extracting Features
5. Exploring Features
6. Baseline Model Testing (VGG16[A1] - InceptionResNetV2[A1-A2] - Xception[A1:A9])
7. Parameters Experments (VGG16[A2] - Xception[A10:14])
8. Additional Experments
    - Augmenting Images and Saving them
    - Sorting them time based, becase keras generate random names
    - Adding the Augmented images + Orignal images to one Dataframe to train '36000' Image
    - Training
9. Testing
    - Testing No.1
    - Testing No.2
    - Testing No.3

Activity Identification:

1. Testing No.1
2. Testing No.2
3. Testing No.3 [Multi-Output Classification]
